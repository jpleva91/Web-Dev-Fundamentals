### Mini-Project Instructions

1. Open the [project page on OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5261196-think-like-a-computer-the-logic-of-programming/5890781-iterate-your-instructions-by-working-with-loops#r-5890894)

1. Complete the assignment and save your written instructions as a file named `loop_logic.md`. 

1. Now that you are familiar with using Git with the command line, you can turn in this assignment that way

1. Save or move your `loop_logic.md` file into the Mini-Project3.1a directory inside your local Git repository (i.e. the folder on your computer called `your-name` that you created in the Unit2 project). The folder location is is (`your-name/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/Unit3/Module3.1/Mini-Project3.1a`)

1. As you have done before, create a new branch (e.g. `mini-project3.1a`), push your local changes to the branch (new file: `loop_logic.md`), then go to GitHub and create a new Pull Request and assign to your coach for review.
