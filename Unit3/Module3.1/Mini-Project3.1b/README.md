### Mini-Project Instructions

1. Open the [project page on OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5261196-think-like-a-computer-the-logic-of-programming/5441446-define-and-send-messages-with-functions#r-5891079)

1. Complete the assignment and save your written instructions as a file named `magic_function.md`. 

1. As you did for Mini-Project3.1a, use Git on the command line to turn in this assignment.

1. Save or move your `magic_function.md` file into the Mini-Project3.1b directory inside your local Git repository (`Web-Dev-Fundamentals/Unit3/Module3.1/Mini-Project3.1b`).

1. As you have done before, create a new branch (e.g. `mini-project3.1b`), push your local changes to the branch (new file: `magic_function.md`), then go to GitHub and create a new Pull Request and assign to your coach for review.
