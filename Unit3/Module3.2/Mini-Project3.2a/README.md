### Welcome to Mini-Project 3.2a!

This mini-project will help you practice writing loops which you learned [in the OC course here](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5664271-learn-programming-with-javascript/6056596-use-the-right-loop-to-repeat-tasks). Loops are tricky so be prepared to spend a bit of time trying out different things until it works. Don't be afraid to experiment with the code.

Here are some additional practice problems that may be helpful:

- [While loop practice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-while-loops)
- [For loop practice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops)

### Mini-Project Instructions

1. Copy the `loop.html` file in `SOURCE_FILES` to `PROJECT_SUBMISSION`.

1. First open the file you just copied (`PROJECT_SUBMISSION/loop.html`) in your browser and open the [Javascript console using Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console).  

1. In the console output you should see `"Starter code is working"`. 

1. Add code that uses the `numLaughs` variable to construct a string of repeating "ha"'s. "ha" is repeated the number of times equal to whatever value is assigned to `numLaughs`. For example, in the code above since the value 4 is assigned, once your code is implemented correctly, the console should output "hahaha". If 2 was entered the output would be "haha", an so on.

1. Test changing the value of `numLaughs` to make sure you get the correct string of "ha"'s. 

1. It's also a good idea to check what are called "edge cases". Make sure your code does not produce an error when you set `numLaughs = 0`.

1. Extra credit: if you implemented this using a while loop, try implementing it again using a for loop, or vice versa.

1. Once you are happy with your code, create a new branch (e.g. `mini-project3.2a`), push your local changes to the branch (new file: `loop.html`), then go to GitHub and create a new Pull Request and assign to your coach for review.
