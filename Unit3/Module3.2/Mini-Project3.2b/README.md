### Welcome to Mini-Project 3.2b!

This mini-project will help you practice writing and understanding functions in Javascript, which you learned [in the OC course here](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5664271-learn-programming-with-javascript/6056621-understand-parameters-and-return-values#r-6853721). This mini-project consists of 3 mini-exercises.

### Mini-Project Instructions

1. Copy the `1_greeting.html` file in `SOURCE_FILES` to `PROJECT_SUBMISSION`.

1. First open the file you just copied (`PROJECT_SUBMISSION/1_greeting.html`) in your browser and open the [Javascript console using Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console).  

1. Use the same approach to solve the problems in each remaining .html  file (`2_repeated_word.html`, `3_random_number_generator.html`).

1. Once you are happy with your code, create a new branch (e.g. `mini-project3.2b`), push your local changes to the branch (which will include 3 new files inside the `PROJECT_SUBMISSION` directory), then go to GitHub and create a new Pull Request and assign to your coach for review.
